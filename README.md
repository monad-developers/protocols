# protocols
This repository maintains details for each protocol on Monad testnet (and later mainnet), to make it easier to interpret ecosystem activity.

Representatives of each protocol should add or adjust their corresponding metadata file as details change (for example, a 
change or addition of contract addresses).

## Form of entries
Each protocol has its own json file in `testnet/PROTOCOL.json`.

The key fields are:
- `name`: Name of protocol.
- `description`: Description of protocol.
- `categories`: Categorization of the protocol as list of category::sub-category pairs, in order of closest, most general, match to
  furthest matching categories.
  * see the categorization section below to see available categories.
  * one category/sub-category pair is enough in most cases, however some protocols are associated with multiple categories.
- `addresses`: A named mapping between contract concept and address.
- `links`: Any links you are willing to provide (typically `project`, `twitter`, `github`, and `docs`).

Here is an example of a file describing a protocol:
```json
{
    "name": "Protocol Name",
    "description": "Protocol description",
    "categories": [
        "Gaming::Games",
        "Gaming::Mobile-First"
    ],
    "addresses": {
        "Data": "0xd9f184B2086d508f94e1aefe11dFABbcD810aeF9",
        "Avatar": "0x78925Ce372c918011Eb2966264b668B2F256224C",
        "Prop": "0x138b7CEaBC3D37a317B837EcF74320432a3A47A2",
        "Weapon": "0x865640F8e435D394519581afA81Ba7135DF668d2"
    },
    "links": {
        "project": "https://www.foo.ai/",
        "twitter": "https://x.com/bar",
        "github": "https://github.com/foo",
        "docs": "https://docs.foo.ai/"
    }
}

```
## How to submit a change
Changes are done on branches and submitted as PRs. Here is a walkthrough of the process:

### Create and switch to a new branch
```
git checkout -b your-protocol/your-branch-name
```

### Make changes and push
Once you have made the desired changes, push to the repository:
```
git push origin your-protocol/your-branch-name
```

### Create a pull request
1. Navigate to your branch on GitHub
   * You'll usually see a banner suggesting to create a PR for your recently pushed branch
2. Click "Compare & pull request" or go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request"
3. Select your branch as the source and the target branch (`main`)
4. Fill in the PR title and description
5. Add reviewer(s)
   * check below for the list of Monad Foundation reviewers 
6. Click "Create pull request"

Note that there are `GitHub Workflow rules` that verify that:
- JSON is valid
- required fields are populated
- categories are valid
- addresses have a valid format

Please ensure your submission is passing before requesting a review.


## Categories
The list of choices for the `category` field appears in `categories.json` and is also listed below. For mental clarity, categories are organized by top-level sectors.

Generally protocols will choose one category, however more than one is permissible, in which case list the the primary category first.
